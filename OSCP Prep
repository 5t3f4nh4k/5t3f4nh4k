# OSCP Prep
===========

### Basic Linux Commands:

man ls                        #man for ls
man -k passwd                 #search in the description for "passwd"
apropos passwd                # same as "man -p passwd"
mkdir "some name"             #create one dir
mkdir -p test/{one,two,three} # create test parrent dir with 3 dirs inside
echo $PATH                    #show dirs in $PATH
which sbd                     #search sbd in dirs from $PATH
locate sbd.exe                #search sbd.exe / quicker than find
sudo updatedb                 #update the locate.db
sudo find / -name sbd*

### Managing Kali Linux Services

sudo systemctl start ssh      #start ssh service
sudo ss -antlp | grep sshd    #using ss and grep to confirm that sshd has been started and running
sudo sustemctl enable ssh     #ssh start at boot  ##we can use apache2 to start HTTP sevice the same way
systemctl list-unit-files     #see table af all available services

### Searching ,INstalling, Removing Tools

sudo apt update
apt-cache search pure-ftpd    #check if pure=httpd is in the Kali repos, it searches in the descriptions, not only package name
apt show resources-agents     #shows description of the resources-agents
sudo apt install pure-https   #install package
apt remove --purge pure-ftpd  #uninstall package (purge removes all data)
sudo dpkg -i man-db_2.7.0.2-5_amd64.deb # -i == --install  ## install package ### don't require to be online #### install with path to deb file

# Bash Environment

echo $PATH                    #search those dirs, when execute command w/o abs path
echo $USER                    #display current username
echo $PWD                     #current dir
echo $HOME                    #home dir

```
export b=10.10.11.11          #with export we can use the var from other shells(Global Var) ## example below
ping -c 2 $b                  #ping with use of var instead the ip address
```

```example
echo "$$" --> 1872
var="My Var"
echo $var --> My Var
bash      --> we are in bash now
echo "$$"  --> 1908
echo $var   --> nothing
exit
# we are in the firsh shell again
echo $Var --> My Var
export othervar="Global Var"
echo $othervar --> Global Var
bash
# we are in bash again
echo $othervar --> Globalvar
```

env                           #show all environment variables

# Bash History Tricks

history
!1
!!                             #some long command, then only !! to execute it as sudo ## in the PWK pdf they say that !! sepeat the last command, but I tried and repeat it with SUDO!

#3.2 Piping and Redirection

echo "test" > redirection_test.txt      #write to the file
scho "test222" >> redirection_test.txt  #append to the file
wc -m < redirect_test.txt --> return word count 89
ls ./test --> error message "no such file" or similar
ls ./test 2>error.txt --> redirect the error message to file

#3.3 Text Search and Manipulation

grep
ls -la /usr/bin | grep zip      #show only lines consist zip in them
sed
echo "I need to try hard" | sed 's/hard/harder/' --> I need to try harder   #sed perform text editing on files or standard output
cut
Echo "I hack binaries, web apps, hkhkhkhkh else" | cut -f 2 -d "," --> web app
cut -d ":" -f 1 /etc/passwd --> show only usernames from the passwd file
